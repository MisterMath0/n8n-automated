# n8n Automated Workflow Generator

An intelligent, chat-based tool for automatically generating [n8n](https://n8n.io/) workflows using the power of AI. Describe your desired workflow in plain English, and watch as it's built for you on an interactive canvas.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Powered Workflow Generation**: Leverages large language models to understand your requirements and generate complex n8n workflows.
-   **Conversational Interface**: A simple and intuitive chat interface to interact with the AI.
-   **Interactive Canvas**: View, and potentially edit, the generated workflows on a zoomable, pannable canvas powered by React Flow.
-   **Multi-Model Support**: Support for various AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
-   **Documentation-Aware**: The AI can search through n8n documentation to build more accurate workflows.
-   **Workflow Management**: Save, view, and manage your generated workflows.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is a monorepo with two main packages:

-   `backend/`: The Python FastAPI application that handles AI logic, workflow generation, and serves the API.
-   `frontend/`: The Next.js web application that provides the user interface.

See the `README.md` files in each directory for more details on each part.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   Python 3.10+ and pip
-   A Supabase project
-   API keys for your chosen AI provider (e.g., OpenAI)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd n8n-automated
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # You will need to set up your environment variables.
    # Create a .env file and add your Supabase and AI provider credentials.
    # Example .env file content:
    # SUPABASE_URL=...
    # SUPABASE_KEY=...
    # OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
    # ... and other necessary variables
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    # You will need to set up your environment variables.
    # Create a .env.local file and add your Supabase credentials.
    # Example .env.local file content:
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
    ```

### Running the application

1.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    # Make sure your virtual environment is activated
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üìñ Usage

1.  Navigate to the chat interface.
2.  Start a conversation by describing the workflow you want to create.
    *Example: "Create a workflow that gets the latest 5 posts from Hacker News and sends them to a Discord channel."*
3.  The AI will ask clarifying questions if needed.
4.  The generated workflow will appear on the canvas.
