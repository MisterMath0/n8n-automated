## User Pain Points (From Research)

### Current Tool Limitations
1. **Incomplete JSON Generation**
   - Tools produce "off" JSON requiring manual fixes
   - Missing node connections and proper IDs
   - Outdated knowledge of N8N's latest features

2. **Accuracy Issues**
   - User quote: *"Claude has knowledge of n8n... and it's created tons a bunch of workflows for me"* (suggesting generic AI is sometimes better)
   - Complex workflows often fail completely

3. **Limited Functionality**
   - Most tools only handle basic workflow patterns
   - Poor support for advanced N8N features
   - No integration with actual N8N instances

### What Users Want
- **Time savings:** *"create, modify, and optimize my workflows in minutes instead of hours"*
- **Accuracy:** Working JSON that doesn't need manual fixing
- **Integration:** Direct connection to their N8N instances
- **Completeness:** Full workflow generation, not just templates
